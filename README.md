## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY/REPORT OUTLINE
In the era of information and technology, digital solutions that improve our experiences and offer personalized suggestions are becoming more and more integrated into our everyday lives. In this regard, our project aims to create a connection between the technological and natural worlds. Our goal was to develop an intelligent system that assists customers select indoor plants that are appropriate for their homes based on plant size and environmental preferences. The idea was to simplify the often-overwhelming process of selecting the right indoor plants and make it accessible to a broad audience.

This report presents the culmination of our efforts to design, develop, and evaluate this intelligent plant recommendation system. We will delve into the architecture, algorithms, and technologies employed to bring this system to life. Moreover, we will discuss the validation of the system, sharing insights into how well it performed in different aspects, including frontend usability and backend recommendation accuracy. By the end of this report, we aim to provide a holistic view of our system, its achievements, and potential for further enhancements in the realm of intelligent reasoning and recommendation systems.
